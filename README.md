### What does it do?
- Random inspiration generator.
- Click on the "Roll" button to generate new settings.

### Why?
- I built this for to have a quick starting point for music making sessions.
- I find it useful to force these limitations.
- Hopefully this will help you as well.
- Feel free to modify the code and make it your own!
- All you have to do go into js/script.js and change the values inside-  the arrays.

### Where can I see the results?
